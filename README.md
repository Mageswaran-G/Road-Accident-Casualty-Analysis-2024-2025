# Road-Accident-Casualty-Analysis-2024-2025
"Data analysis and visualization of vehicle accident casualties across various conditions (Road type, time, area) for 2024-2025."

🚦 Accident Casualties Analysis (2024-2025)

🌟 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of 417,883 vehicle accident casualties recorded between 2024 and 2025. The primary goal was to dissect key variables—including road type, lighting conditions, and road surface—to identify actionable insights for improving road safety and resource allocation.

**Total Casualties:** 417,883

📊 Key Findings: A Storytelling Summary

The analysis reveals several critical, and sometimes counter-intuitive, factors driving casualty rates:

1. Severity Distribution

While the sheer number of Slight Casualties (351,436) dominates, the analysis highlights the proportion of high-impact events:

Severity,Count,% of Total,Insight

Slight-->  "351,436",84.1%   Represents the majority of incidents.
Serious->  "59,312",14.2%    Requires significant emergency response capacity.
Fatal--->  "7,135",1.7%      The most critical area for prevention strategies.


2. Road Type is the Single Biggest Factor

The type of road is the strongest predictor of casualty volume:
Single Carriageway: Accounts for a massive 309.7K casualties. This indicates that undivided roads remain the highest risk environment.

**Dual Carriageway:** 67.4K casualties.
**Roundabouts:** 26.8K casualties.


3. Condition vs. Driver Behavior

The data suggests that the majority of accidents are not primarily driven by adverse environmental conditions:

Condition,Count,Distribution

Dry Road   "279,445",∼67%
Wet Road   "115,261",∼28%
Snow/Ice   "22,781",∼5%

Similarly, lighting conditions show that Daylight is when most accidents occur:

Daylight: 304,963 casualties (73%)
Dark: 112,920 casualties (27%)

**Key Insight:** The high casualty numbers during Dry/Daylight conditions strongly imply that factors like speed, distraction, and driver error are the dominant causes, rather than visibility or poor weather.

4. Area Type and Vehicle Impact

**Area:** Urban areas (255.9K) see significantly more casualties than Rural areas (162.0K), likely due to higher traffic density.
**Top Vehicle:** Cars (333,485) are involved in the vast majority of incidents, reflecting their prevalence on the road.


This project utilized Microsoft Excel for the entire end-to-end data analysis and visualization pipeline.

**Tools Used**
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and dashboard creation.

💡 **Conclusion: Actionable Insights for Safer Roads**

This analysis of 417,883 casualties provides a clear mandate for road safety efforts:

Shift Focus to Behavior: The majority of casualties occur in Daylight on Dry Roads. This strongly indicates that driver behavior (speed, distraction) must be the primary focus of prevention campaigns, rather than solely weather-related risks.

Infrastructure Priority: Single Carriageway roads are the biggest risk factor, accounting for the vast majority of incidents. Targeted infrastructure improvements and revised speed limits on these roads offer the greatest opportunity for casualty reduction.

**In summary**, this data-driven project provides the foundation for strategically allocating resources toward behavioral change and improving high-risk single carriageway infrastructure to save lives.
